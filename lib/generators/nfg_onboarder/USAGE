Description:
  Creates files for a new onboarder and its steps. If the onboarder doesn't exist, it will be created.

  The OnboarderGroupName is optional. This is used when you want to have several onboarders linked together

Example:
  rails generate nfg_onboarder:onboarder OnboarderName[::OnboarderGroupName] step1 step2 ...

  i.e. rails generate nfg_onboarder:onboarder CreateProject project_name project_description

  This will create:
    app/forms/onboarding/create_project/project_name.rb
    app/views/onboarding/create_project/project_name.html.haml
    app/forms/onboarding/create_project/project_description.rb
    app/views/onboarding/create_project/project_description.html.haml
    app/controllers/onboarding/create_project_controller.rb
    config/locales/onboarding/create_project.yml
  This updates
    config/routes

  i.e. rails generate nfg_onboarder:onboarder InitialSteps::CreateProject project_name project_description

  This will create:
    app/forms/onboarding/initial_steps/create_project/project_name.rb
    app/views/onboarding/initial_steps/create_project/project_name.html.haml
    app/forms/onboarding/initial_steps/create_project/project_description.rb
    app/views/onboarding/initial_steps/create_project/project_description.html.haml
    app/controllers/onboarding/initial_steps_controller.rb
    app/controllers/onboarding/initial_steps/create_project_controller.rb
    config/locales/onboarding/initial_steps/create_project.yml

  This updates
    config/routes
